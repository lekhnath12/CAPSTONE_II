# Risk Assessment and financial management of Lending club. 

As a part of the Springboard data science curriculum, this project focuses in helping the Lending club improve its financial management and perform risk assesment of the loans. The data used here is the open access data provided by the Lending club (for convenience, a copy of data exists in the link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HbrdwXb7JU3Ye6xfRLcBLbXBPs28_ipP) . The files should run in the following sequence: 

(1) Data_wrangling

(2) Data Exploration, Gradient_boosting_Randomized Search, Predicting_returns

(3) Gradient_boosting

(4) Risk_comparision

Further, the 'Report.pdf' provides a non-technical summary of this project.
